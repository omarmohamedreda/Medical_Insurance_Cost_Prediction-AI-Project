## Introduction

The cost of medical insurance is influenced by various factors, such as age, gender, BMI, smoking status, and region. This project aims to predict insurance costs based on these features using supervised machine learning.

---

## Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project includes the following features:
- **Age**: Age of the individual.
- **Sex**: Gender (male or female).
- **BMI**: Body Mass Index, a measure of body fat based on height and weight.
- **Children**: Number of dependents.
- **Smoker**: Whether the individual is a smoker (yes/no).
- **Region**: Residential region (e.g., northeast, southeast, etc.).
- **Charges**: Medical insurance cost (target variable).

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading**: Importing and understanding the structure of the dataset.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: 
   - Visualizing data distributions.
   - Understanding correlations between features.
3. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handling missing values.
   - Encoding categorical variables.
   - Normalizing numerical features.
4. **Model Development**:
   - Training machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, or others.
   - Hyperparameter tuning.
5. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Assessing performance using metrics like RMSE, R-squared, etc.
6. **Results Analysis**: Visualizing the predictions and residuals.
